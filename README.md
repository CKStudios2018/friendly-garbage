# friendly-garbage
This repo isn't worth much more than a pat on the back for github.com servers.

We use this repo to store old projects, to go back to later. Most of these will become deprecated by the times we get around to it, but you never know..

## What to expect:
* Deprecated projects (old code)
* Useless garbage
* Some really broken stuff
* Bugs (and not the nice kind)
* Abandoned projects
* Useful code
* ~~Cheesecake~~
